# AI-Based Network Analysis Project

## Overview
The AI-Based Network Analysis Project is designed to enhance network performance and security by utilizing AI to analyze bandwidth usage, monitor node resources via SNMP, and provide real-time network insights through a dashboard.

## Features

### 1. AI-Powered Bandwidth Analysis
- Extracts and formats bandwidth usage data from network nodes.
- AI model detects services based on bandwidth consumption.
- Assigns priority levels to services.
- Can be integrated with routers to allocate bandwidth based on service priority.

### 2. SNMP-Based Resource Monitoring
- Monitors CPU, RAM, and storage usage of network nodes.
- Provides real-time insights into resource utilization.
- Helps in detecting performance bottlenecks and anomalies.

### 3. Network Monitoring Dashboard
- Displays the status of machines on the network.
- Shows real-time ping responses.
- Scans and lists open ports on network nodes.
- Retrieves and displays installed software packages on each machine.

## Usage
- Start the AI-based analysis to monitor bandwidth usage.
- Use SNMP monitoring to keep track of network node performance.
- Access the dashboard to view real-time network status and insights.

## Future Enhancements
- Automated anomaly detection for unusual network activity.
- Enhanced AI model for predictive bandwidth allocation.
- Integration with more network protocols for expanded monitoring.
